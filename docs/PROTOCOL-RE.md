# Reverse-engineering the Nord USB protocol

Decoding `.ns4p` files is solved (100% parameter coverage). Generating a valid
checksum is in progress (`docs/CHECKSUM.md`). The remaining frontier is **direct
device transfer**: reading a program off the Stage 4 and writing one back over
USB, without Nord Sound Manager in the loop.

This is legitimate interoperability reverse-engineering of hardware you own. The
goal is an open client that speaks the same protocol — not redistributing
Clavia's software. Keep captures and notes for the protocol; don't republish
their binaries.

There are **two layers**. Attack the cheap one first.

## Layer 1 — USB-MIDI SysEx (try this first)

Nords are MIDI-native, and patch-transfer-over-SysEx is proven on older Clavia
hardware (the Nord Lead 3 librarian). If the Stage 4 dumps programs as SysEx you
never touch raw USB — you monitor at the MIDI layer, which is far easier.
See `docs/SYSEX-SPIKE.md` for the focused experiment; `src/lib/midi/sysex.ts`
has the listener + Clavia `0x33` envelope helpers.

- Clavia manufacturer id is `0x33`: a Nord SysEx message is `F0 33 … F7`.
- Tools: Snoize **SysEx Librarian** + **MIDI Monitor** (macOS), or a Web MIDI
  page with `requestMIDIAccess({ sysex: true })` (any Chromium).
- **Size tell:** an `.ns4p` is 868 bytes, but a SysEx dump is *larger* — MIDI
  data bytes are 7-bit only, so binary is 7-to-8 or nibble encoded. Traffic
  roughly 1.14× (7→8) or 2× (nibble) the file size is your program. If you see
  that, Layer 2 is moot.

Win condition: receive a dump, send it back, confirm the program loads intact.

## Layer 2 — Raw USB capture (if it's a vendor bulk protocol)

If Sound Manager uses a vendor-specific interface instead of MIDI, use the
standard capture-and-differential playbook below. It's the same differential
method that cracked the file layout: **change one variable, capture, diff.**

> **Known command vocabulary (from `docs/NSM-TEARDOWN.md`).** The client's own
> `Ymer::ProtocolManager` request classes name the operations you'll see on the
> wire — use them to label captures: `Download` / `DownloadBank`, `Upload` /
> `UploadBank` / `UploadStream`, `Copy`, `Move`, `Swap`, `Delete`, `Erase`,
> `Format`, `Convert`, `Get/SetDependency` (sample links), `Get/SetFocus`,
> `PartList`, `PartStates`, `PartitionState`, `QryContentVersion`,
> `SetFileProps`. Async replies: `NotifyStarted/Progress/Completed/State`. Storage
> model is **partition → bank → location/slot**. Start by capturing a single
> `Download` (read one program) — it's read-only and the simplest framing.

> **RESULT — protocol recovered statically from the binary (2026-06).** Ghidra
> decompilation of `Zevs::Port` + `Zevs::Protocol::FileTransfer` gives the full
> wire format without any capture. Each message (all fields **big-endian**):

> [u32 protocolId]  0x0000000C  = FileTransfer  (MIDIX/InstrCtrl have other ids)
> [u32 version]     protocol EVersion
> [u32 msgId]       opcode (table below)
> [ payload ]       msgId-specific, a sequence of big-endian u32 words

### Step 1 — Descriptor recon: what is the device?

```bash
# Linux
lsusb                       # find the Clavia/Nord vendor:product id
lsusb -v -d <vid>:<pid>     # full descriptors
```
(Windows: **USB Device Tree Viewer**. macOS: **System Information → USB**.)

Read the interface descriptors:
- `bInterfaceClass 0x01` / `bInterfaceSubClass 0x03` → **USB-MIDI**. Go back to
  Layer 1; the transfer almost certainly rides on SysEx.
- `bInterfaceClass 0xFF` (vendor-specific) with **bulk IN/OUT endpoints** → a
  custom protocol. Continue below.

Record the endpoint addresses (e.g. `0x01` OUT, `0x81` IN) and max packet sizes.

> **DONE — confirmed on real hardware (2026-06).** Captured passively via libusb
> (`scripts/nordusb.c` — reads the cached config descriptor, no interface claim,
> no conflict with a running NSM):
>
> - **Device:** VID `0x0FFC` (Clavia DMI AB), PID `0x002E` (Nord Stage 4),
>   bcdDevice `0x0154` (firmware 3.40), 1 configuration, 3 interfaces.
> - **Interface 0 — vendor-specific** (`class/sub/proto = 0xFF/0xFF/0xFF`), 3 EPs
>   — **this is the NSM transfer channel** (`Ymer::USB` / `CFTReq*`):
>
>   | EP | Type | Dir | MaxPkt | Role |
>   |---|---|---|---|---|
>   | `0x03` | BULK | OUT | 64 | host→device commands (`CFTReq*`) |
>   | `0x82` | BULK | IN | 64 | device→host data (Download payloads) |
>   | `0x81` | INTERRUPT | IN | 16 | async notifications (`CFTNotify*`) |
>
> - **Interface 1** — Audio control (class 1/1), 0 EPs.
> - **Interface 2** — USB-**MIDI** streaming (class 1/3): bulk `0x04` OUT, `0x84`
>   IN. This is the class-compliant MIDI path (CC/NRPN/SysEx) — *separate* from the
>   vendor transfer interface, confirming program transfer is **not** MIDI.
>
> **Constraint:** while NSM runs it holds interface 0 **exclusively**
> (`UsbExclusiveOwner = "Nord Sound Manager"`, two live IOKit user-clients). To

### Step 2 — Passive capture: the Rosetta Stone

Sniff Sound Manager ↔ Nord performing one known operation.

| Platform | Tool |
|---|---|
| Linux | `sudo modprobe usbmon` → Wireshark on `usbmonX` (best signal/noise) |
| Windows | **USBPcap** → Wireshark |
| macOS | Apple **USB** capture (`AppleUSBHostPacketFilter`, from Additional Tools for Xcode) → Wireshark |

Capture filter tip: isolate by bus/device address so you only see the Nord.

> **macOS reality check (tested).** There is no `usbmon`. Homebrew Wireshark does
> **not** capture USB on macOS by itself — you need Apple's `AppleUSBHostPacketFilter`
> (Additional Tools for Xcode → system-extension approval → reboot; SIP friction on
> Apple Silicon). `brew install` alone is insufficient.
>
> **VM passthrough caveat.** To sniff the *official* client you must run NSM where
> the capture is — and **NSM has no Linux build**, so a Linux VM (or OrbStack,
> which can't pass USB through at all — it's on Apple Virtualization.framework)
> does **not** help here. A **Windows** VM with real USB passthrough (UTM /
> Parallels / VMware — not OrbStack) + **USBPcap** + the Windows NSM build is the
> only VM route that captures the real client.
>
> **Most practical on this Mac:** skip sniffing and do **active replay** (Step 5):
> quit NSM, claim interface 0 with libusb/node-usb, and probe `0x03`/`0x82`
> directly — read-only `Download` first.

### Step 3 — Differential analysis: provoke one thing at a time

This is the core technique. Each capture pins down one field.

1. Request program at slot **H:13**, then **H:14**. Diff the outgoing packets →
   that delta is the **address/slot field**.
2. Back up program X, then back up X again after moving **one** knob → diff the
   inbound data → isolates payload layout and shows whether the **same 32-bit
   checksum** from the file rides in the transfer.
3. Repeat for: request-dump vs. send-dump, single program vs. bank, name change.

Build a request/response table as you go. Keep every capture (see the log
template below) so findings are reproducible by other contributors.

### Step 4 — Structural analysis

In the framed bytes, hunt for:
- a fixed **command header / opcode** (first bytes constant across same-type ops);
- a **length field** (value tracks payload size);
- the **address/slot** (found in step 3.1);
- the **32-bit checksum** (likely the one from `docs/CHECKSUM.md` — confirm by
  matching bytes 24–27 of a known file against the transfer);
- **7-bit encoding** (only if it turns out to be MIDI after all).

### Step 5 — Replay & probe

Send a captured **read** request back to the device and confirm an identical
response. Replay proves the framing before you synthesize new commands.

```js
// node-usb sketch (desktop/Electron); WebUSB is the browser equivalent.
// Real values from the hardware recon in Step 1 (quit NSM first — it holds
// interface 0 exclusively).
const { usb } = require('usb');
const dev = usb.findByIds(0x0ffc, 0x002e); // Clavia : Nord Stage 4
dev.open();
const iface = dev.interface(0);            // vendor-specific 0xFF interface
if (iface.isKernelDriverActive()) iface.detachKernelDriver();
iface.claim();
const out  = iface.endpoint(0x03);         // BULK OUT — CFTReq commands
const inn  = iface.endpoint(0x82);         // BULK IN  — Download payloads
const note = iface.endpoint(0x81);         // INTERRUPT IN — CFTNotify progress
note.startPoll(1, 16);
note.on('data', (d) => { /* CFTNotify* started/progress/completed */ });
out.transfer(cftReqDownloadBytes, () => inn.transfer(4096, (e, data) => {
  /* compare data to the program body / file */
}));
```

### Step 6 — Reimplement

- Vendor bulk: `node-usb` (Electron desktop) or **WebUSB** (Chromium).
- SysEx after all: **CoreMIDI** (iOS) / **Web MIDI** (`sysex: true`).

---

## Safety

- **Read is safe; write can brick a slot.** Do Layer 1 and steps 1–5 entirely
  read-only first. Replaying *read* requests cannot harm the keyboard.
- Only attempt **writes** once framing + checksum are solid, and only to a
  throwaway program slot. Firmware is rarely at risk, a single slot is.
- Back up the full instrument with Sound Manager before any write experiment.

## Realistic odds

- **Best case (SysEx):** a weekend.
- **Worst case (sealed/obfuscated bulk):** large, possibly indefinite. Even a
  documented "it's a bulk protocol, here's the evidence" is a real result.
- **Leverage the community:** check the Nord User Forum for existing descriptors
  or captures before starting cold.

## Capture log template

Record every capture identically so they compose. One file per capture under
`docs/captures/` (gitignore the raw `.pcap`/`.syx` if large; commit the notes).
